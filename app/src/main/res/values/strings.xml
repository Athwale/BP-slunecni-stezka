        <h2>The Sun trail</h2>
        <p>
        The Sun trail of Křtiny is a model of our Solar system scaled to 1:1 milliard.
        All models of planets and the Sun and the distances you have to walk on the trail are also
        scaled as written above.
        </p>
        <p>
        At each station you will find a sphere representing the given planet. You can read the
        information about the planet on the nearby board.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our Sun trail was inspired by <a href="http://www.astrohk.cz/planetarni_stezka/">.
        Planetary trail build by the observatory in Hradec Králové</a>, but it is not just a plain
        copy. The realization of this trail was originally supposed to be self aided. But thanks to
        the support of ŠLP Křtiny and the South moravian district it was possible to build a more
        elaborate version of this trail. The main part was being built in the year 2014 and opened
        int the year 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you follow this trail you will be able to try on your own how close or far away the planets
        in our Solar system are. At the same time you will experience the nice landscape of Křtiny.
        </p>

        <h2>The path</h2>
        <p>
        The Sun trail can be walked through from both ends. You can start at the Sun in Křtiny and finish
        at the Neptune near ŠLP Křtiny arboretum. Then you can continue and follow the yellow marking
        towards Jedovnice or get on the <a href="http://idsjmk.cz/jrady/201.pdf">IDS JMK number 201 (Křtiny, Hájovna na lukách)</a> bus.<br>
        Other than that you can approach the Sun from the other end of the trail and begin at Neptune.
        </p>
        <p>
        The trail follows well marked path mostly inside a forrest and has a length of about 4.5 km.
        For better orientation you can use the provided map. If you are going to return to Křtiny on foot
        double the distance. You will only need casual footwear for this trail.

        <p>
        You can also take a shorter variant of the trail which ends at Saturn. After that you will
        return from Viligrunt. (Saturn is about 1.5km from the beginning of the trail).
        </p>
        <p>
        Translations of the information boards into English and German can be found in this app.<br>
        <b>You can also play a game during which you will use your phone or tablet.</b>

        <p>
        The following picture shows a scheme of the orbits of planets and other astronomical objects
        in our Solar system. These are those you will encounter on the Sun trail. The inner part of the
        Solar system is enlarged 10 times for clarity.<br>
        The gauge is in astronomical units.<br>(1 AU = 149 597 870,691 km)<br>
        The guidelines mark the positions of planets, (1) Ceres and comet 1P/Halley on September 1st 2003.

        The belt between Mars and Jupiter contains a lot of objects which are smaller than

        Ceres. Next discovered objects were Pallas, Juno and Vesta. Non of them is observable by the
        bare eyes only. There is about 100 000 astronomical objects larger than 1 km. Their combined
        mass though is less than the mass of Mercury. Most of these objects have not had gone
        through the phase of remelting in the past. The temperature and pressure inside these small
        objects was not high enough. They therefore most probably consist of the type of rock from

        Because of the existence of liquid water on Earth, it is the only planet known to support
        life. The Earth was formed about 4,56 milliard years ago, together with the Sun and other
        objects of the Solar system. It is almost the same planet as Mercury, Venus or Mars. It has
        an iron core and a thick rocky layer. The Earth is not exactly round – it is slightly
        flattened (the polar diameter is 12 714 km). The Earth orbits the Sun and rotates around
        it’s own axis. But it also makes other movements. The most significant is axial precession,
        which is the change in orientation of the Earth’s rotational axis, which happens every
        26 500 years. Currently, the Earth’s axis points towards the star Polaris. The Solar system
        consists of eight orbiting planets but there are more than one thousand extrasolar planets,
        which orbit other stars.

        Orbits of comets are usually elongated, elliptical and more inclined to the plane of
        ecliptic than the orbits of planets. When the comet approaches the Sun to the distance of
        Mars it heats up enough that the ice starts to sublime and a cloud of dust and gasses forms
        the cometary coma the nebulous envelope around the nucleus of a comet. Interactions with the
        Solar wind then creates the tail. You can only see the nucleus of the comet at this stop.
        While the nucleus is usually small - kilometers or tens of kilometers, the coma can be as
        large as thousands or even millions of kilometers. The tail can be more than 150 million km
        long (the distance between the Sun and the Earth). That would be hundreds of meters on our
        trail.

        Although Edmund Halley (1656–1742) did not discover the comet, he was the first to predict
        the comet`s return.

        Despite the fact that Jupiter weights less than 1/1000 of mass of the Sun, it is still the
        largest planet of the Solar system. Compared to the four inner planets, Jupiter and other
        outer planets have a relatively small rocky core, bulky hydrogen or icy layer, and a large
        and gradually thinning atmosphere. Consequently, we do not observe sharply defined surface
        boundaries for these outer planets. In 1610, Galileo Galilei discovered with his telescope
        four big moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. To show these moons in our
        model of Solar system, they would need to be around 3 mm in diameter and would orbit Jupiter
        in distances ranging from 42 to 189 cm.

        The Moon orbits around the Earth as a natural satellite. Compared to the Earth, the Moon is
        four times smaller. Since it`s orbital period around Earth is the same as it`s sidereal
        rotation period, only one hemisphere of the Moon is always facing the Earth. This phenomenon
        is called rare rotation and it is caused by Earth`s tidal forces which slowed down original
        faster Moon`s rotation in the past. According to nowadays knowledge the Moon formed after
        the "proto-Earth" was hit by an astronomical object about the size of Mars. A large number
        of debris from the collision then either fell back onto Earth or formed a ring which later
        through collisions and gravity created the Moon.

        <b>The mythological origin of the name:</b> the Moon is called "Luna" in poetry. This name

        temperature is about 15 million °C, the pressure is 2,48·10^16 Pa (the standard pressure on
        Earth is 101 325 Pa) and density is 162 000 kg/m3. Under these conditions, the nuclei of
        hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium atoms and generate photons and neutrinos. Photon
        luminosity of the Sun is 3,85 · 10^26 W. Energy of about 342W per 1 m2 lands on Earth and
        this energy enables the existence of life on our planet. The Sun is between 4.6 to 4.7
        billion years old and it will continue to shine for another 5 billion years. At the end of
        its life, the Sun will go through the state of a red giant. At the speed of about 1 000km/s,
        the atmosphere of this red giant will separate to expose the Sun`s core. This event will be
        observable as a cooling white dwarf and its expanding cover will create planetary nebula.

        <b>The mythological origin of the name:</b> people were always aware of the Sun’s existence.
        Many of their gods were linked to the Sun. In the ancient Egypt, god of the Sun was called Ra.
        For Greeks, the god of the Sun was Apollo.

        The Venus is always shrouded into dense clouds. Therefore direct sunlight can not be seen
        from the surface. High surface temperature (Even higher than on Mercury) is caused by the
        greenhouse effect - visible sunlight passes through the atmosphere, heats up the surface
        which then radiates in infrared radiation. This radiation is effectively absorbed by the
        atmosphere heating it up. Similar process is happening in Earth`s atmosphere but it is less
        effective. The planet Venus revolves around it`s axis very slowly and to the opposite
        direction than the direction Venus orbits around the Sun.

        Guinea pigs or even kittens do not amaze anybody nowadays. Today`s internet is filled by
        space animals. The animal you are transporting came to our Solar system from Proxima
        Centauri. It became very popular because it changes color based on it`s mood. They are also
        sold under the name Indicator. There is a manual which you can get that explains their
        feelings by their color. A mobile app also appeared which translates the color of your pet
        to it`s mood from a photograph.

        Torn solar sails can slow down any solar sailing vessel. This is one of the reasons repair
        bots were made for. But they also take care of space stations and satellites. They can
        automatically recognize various defects and repair the damage. They carry a set of useful
        tools with them at all times to repair almost anything. The last repair bot prototype
        consists of small blocks which can build any shape necessary. Currently the manufacturer is
        trying to solve a minor problem of them self replicating.

        The Pulsed microwave stun gun is a defensive weapon developed after the Black Mesa incident.
        Using a series of five microwave impulses it creates a ionized conductive channel up to a
        distance of 34 m. Then the weapon sends a high voltage 25 000 up to 200 000 volts pulse
        through the channel. Since electricity always flows through the path of least resistance,
        the impulse goes through the channel and hits the target.
