        Ceres. Next discovered objects were Pallas, Juno and Vesta. Non of them is observable by the
        bare eyes only. There is about 100 000 astronomical objects larger than 1 km. Their combined
        mass though is less than the mass of Mercury. Most of these objects have not had gone
        through the phase of remelting in the past. The temperature and pressure inside these small
        objects was not high enough. They therefore most probbaly consist of the type of rock from
        which larger planets formed.

        Because of the existence of liquid water on Earth, it is the only planet known to support
        life. The Earth was formed about 4,56 milliard years ago, together with the Sun and other
        objects of the Solar system. It is almost the same planet as Mercury, Venus or Mars. It has
        an iron core and a thick rocky layer. The Earth is not exactly round – it is slightly
        flattened (the polar diameter is 12 714 km). The Earth orbits the Sun and rotates around
        it’s own axis. But it also makes other movements. The most significant is axial precession,
        which is the change in orientation of the Earth’s rotational axis, which happens every
        26 500 years. Currently, the Earth’s axis points towards the star Polaris. The Solar system
        consists of eight orbiting planets but there are more than one thousand extrasolar planets,
        which orbit other stars.

        Orbits of comets are usually elongated, alliptical and more inclined to the plane of
        ecliptic than the orbits of planets. When the comet approaches the Sun to the distance of
        Mars it heats up enough that the ice starts to sublime and a cloud of dust and gasses forms
        the cometary coma the nebulous envelope around the nucleus of a comet. Interactions with the
        Solar wind then creates the tail. You can only see the nucleus of the comet at this stop.
        While the nucleus is usually small - kilometers or tens of kilometers, the coma can be as
        large as thousands or even millions of kilometers. The tail can be more than 150 million km
        long (the distance between the Sun and the Earth). That would be hundrets of meters on our
        path.

        Despite the fact that Jupiter weights less than 1/1000 of mass of the Sun, it is still the
        largest planet of the Solar system. Compared to the four inner planets, Jupiter and other
        outer planets have a relatively small rocky core, bulky hydrogen or icy layer, and a large
        and gradually thinning atmosphere. Consequently, we do not observe sharply defined surface
        boundaries for these outer planets. In 1610, Galileo Galilei discovered with his telescope
        four big moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. To show these moons in our
        model of Solar system, they would need to be around 3 mm in diameter and would orbit Jupiter
        in distances ranging from 42 to 189 cm.

        If you look at Mars you will immediately notice the distinctive red color. This is caused by

        not exist on Mars because the atmosphere is too thin (atmospheric pressure on Mars is 100

        Planets, differently from the stars, do not shine by themselves but only reflect light from
        the Sun. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. Astronomers previously tried to discover
        a hypothetical planet Vulcan that would orbit even closer but were not successful. Even
        though Mercury is small (about the size of our Moon), it has a massive iron core.

        The Moon orbits around the Earth as a natural satellite. Compared to the Earth, the Moon is
        four times smaller. Since it`s orbital period around Earth is the same as it`s sidereal
        rotation period, only one hemisphere of the Moon is always facing the Earth. This phenomenon
        is called rare rotation and it is caused by Earth`s tidal forces which slowed down original
        faster Moon`s rotation in the past. According to nowadays knowledge the Moon formed after
        the "proto-Earth" was hit by an astronomical object about the size of Mars. A large number
        of debris from the collision then either fell back onto Earth or formed a ring which later
        through collisions and gravity created the Moon.
        </p>
        <b>The mythological origin of the name:</b> the Moon is called "Luna" in poetry. This name
        comes from Latin. The Roman goddess who had this name was an analogy to the Greek Selene.
        Later also Artemis became the goddess of the Moon. Hekate was the goddess of the Moon in
        it`s invisible phase.

        luminosity of the Sun is 3,85 · 10^26 W. Energy of about 342W per 1 m2 lands on Earth and

        The Venus is always shrouded into dense clouds. Therefore direct sunlight can not be seen
        from the surface. High surface temperature (Even higher than on Mercury) is caused by the
        greenhouse effect - visible sunlight passes through the atmosphere, heats up the surface
        which then radiates in infrared radiation. This radiation is effectively absorbed by the
        atmosphere heating it up. Similar process is happening in Earth`s atmosphere but it is less
        effective. The planet Venus revolves around it`s axis very slowly and to the opposite
        direction than the direction Venus orbits around the Sun.

        <b>The mythological origin of the name:</b> the Venus was a Roman analogy to the Greek
        goddess of love, beauty and fertility - Aphrodite. She was born from the sea foam which came
        to existence from the penis of castrated Uranus.
